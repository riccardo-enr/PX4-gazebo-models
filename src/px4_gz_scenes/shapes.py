"""
Primitive geometry types for scene construction.

Shapes describe geometry only — no pose, no label. Pose and semantics are
attached by SceneObject. All shapes are immutable (frozen dataclasses).

Coordinate convention: shapes are defined in their own local frame with the
origin at the geometric centre. The parent SceneObject's `position` field
places that centre in the scene frame.

Supported primitives:
  Box       — axis-aligned rectangular cuboid
  Cylinder  — circular cylinder aligned with local +Z
  Sphere    — sphere
  Composite — ordered collection of (shape, offset, rotation) children

The `Shape` union type covers all four primitives.

The `aabb` function returns a conservative axis-aligned bounding box for any
shape in its local frame, expressed as (min_corner, max_corner) Vec3 pairs.
Exporters (voxeliser, SDF generator, …) can use this without knowing the
concrete shape type.
