"""
Private quaternion / rotation utilities shared by exporters.

These helpers are not part of the public API — import from ``px4_gz_scenes``
directly for public symbols.

All quaternions follow the Hamilton convention ``(w, x, y, z)`` used
throughout the package.  Rotation matrices are ``(3, 3)`` float64 NumPy
arrays that act on **column vectors**: ``p_rotated = R @ p``.  For
batch operations use :func:`apply_rotation`, which accepts any leading
batch dimensions ``(..., 3)``.
